Introduction
Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, leading to various symptoms and health complications. This project employs machine learning techniques to estimate the risk of heart failure based on patients' medical history and other pertinent factors.

Features

Predicts the likelihood of heart failure in patients.
Utilizes a variety of machine learning algorithms.
Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.x
Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running example notebooks)
